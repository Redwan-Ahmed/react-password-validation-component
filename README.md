# Password Validation Component - React 
👉[Demo](https://redwan-react-pw-component.netlify.app/)👈

## What is this project? 🤔
* I made a reusable function component, which validates a password's input field.

## My approach to this project: 🧐
* I wanted to practice my react hooks skills, so I made a reusable component which can be used in future projects.
1. useStates was used to store the state of the input & the boolean validation states.
2. useEffect was used to track the changes to the validation boolean's and the password state.
3. I used an inline If-Else with Conditional Operator to manipulate the css.

## Technologies used: 🖥
1. React
2. Semantic UI - for CSS
